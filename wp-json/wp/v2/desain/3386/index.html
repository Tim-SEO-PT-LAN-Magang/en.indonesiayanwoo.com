Edible bird&#8217;s nest nests are highly valued in the world market, especially in Asia. Swiftlet&#8217;s nest is usually used as an ingredient in making soup and other health foods.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>In addition to producing high-quality edible bird&#8217;s nests, the Markas Walet also provides services for making good and quality swiftlet house designs. This design is very important because a good swiftlet house will produce high quality edible bird&#8217;s nests as well.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>One form of swiftlet house that is becoming popular is the swiftlet house with a size of 10 \u00d7 10. The swiftlet house is ideal for breeders who are just starting their business or who have limited land.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Here are some things that need to be considered in making a swiftlet house design with a size of 10 \u00d7 10:<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Swiftlet Colony Placement<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiftlet colony placement must be considered carefully. Usually swiftlet colonies are placed at the top of the building, with a distance between the bottom of the colony and the roof of about 80-100 cm. This space is needed so that the swiftlet can fly and store the nest in it.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Cage Size<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of the cage is very important in making a swiftlet house. As previously mentioned, the most frequently used size is 10\u00d710 meters. However, this size can be adjusted to the number of swiftlets to be bred.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Air Circulation<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Good air circulation is very important for maintaining swiftlet health and increasing nest production. Therefore, in the design of a swiftlet&#8217;s house, adequate ventilation must be considered. Ventilation can be in the form of gaps in the roof or ventilation from fans.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Lighting<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting in the swiftlet house is very important to maintain the health condition of the swiftlet. Sufficient light will help in the formation of nests and organic compounds in swiftlets. Therefore, the lighting used must be sufficient but not too bright so as not to disturb the swiftlet&#8217;s activities.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Building Materials<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Building materials used in the manufacture of swiftlet houses must also be considered. Because bird&#8217;s nest on the ceiling, the ceiling and roof must be made of quality, waterproof and rust-resistant materials. The materials usually used are aluminum, iron or mild steel.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Cleanliness<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleanliness in the swiftlet house must be considered. Edible bird&#8217;s nest is a very valuable and very important item for breeders. Therefore, cleanliness must be maintained properly, especially the parts where there are bird&#8217;s nests or droppings.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Manufacturing Cost<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of making swiftlet bird houses varies depending on the type and materials used. Making a swiftlet house with a size of 10\u00d710 meters is estimated to cost around 80 million to 100 million rupiah. However, these costs may vary depending on the capabilities and needs of the farmer.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>In making swiftlet houses, breeders can choose services from companies such as the Markas Walet which provide design and manufacturing services for swiftlet houses with sizes and shapes that are tailored to their needs. By using this service, farmers can obtain good and optimal quality swiftlet houses to produce high quality swiftlet nests.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h5>Conclusion<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The swiftlet house design with a size of 10\u00d710 meters is ideal for breeders who are just starting their business or who have limited land. A good and quality swiftlet house is very important to produce high quality edible bird&#8217;s nests. Some things that need to be considered in making a swiftlet house include the placement of swiftlet colonies, the size of the cage, air circulation, lighting, building materials, cleanliness, and manufacturing costs. Breeders can choose services from companies such as the Markas Walet which provide design and manufacturing services for swiftlet houses with good and optimal quality. Thus, it is hoped that breeders can obtain high-quality swiftlet nests and increase their production.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":3400,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/en.indonesiayanwoo.com.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/desain\/3386"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/en.indonesiayanwoo.com.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/desain"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/en.indonesiayanwoo.com.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/desain"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/en.indonesiayanwoo.com.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3400"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/en.indonesiayanwoo.com.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3386"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
