Many people consume it because it is believed to have high health benefits. Edible bird&#8217;s nest contains essential amino acids required by the body, including lysine and arginine which help to increase muscle mass and strengthen the immune system. Additionally, the collagen content in edible bird&#8217;s nest also helps to improve skin and hair structure.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but several studies also indicate that edible bird&#8217;s nest can help maintain heart health. Edible bird&#8217;s nest contains bioactive compounds that help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and stabilize blood pressure. Furthermore, edible bird&#8217;s nest also helps to increase good cholesterol (HDL) in the body which can help maintain heart health.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, it is advisable to consult a doctor or nutritionist before consuming edible bird&#8217;s nest, especially for people with certain medical conditions such as allergies or specific health problems.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Swiftlet: Prohibited for Consumption According to Shafi&#8217;i and Hanbali Scholars<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Swiftlets, which produce edible bird&#8217;s nest, have become controversial when it comes to discussing whether they can be consumed or not. According to Shafi&#8217;i and Hanbali scholars, swiftlets are considered haram or prohibited for consumption. The reason being that swiftlets do not have clear indications as to whether they are halal or haram. Additionally, swiftlets also have physical characteristics that resemble scavenger birds, such as their small heads and long beaks.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, in some countries such as China and Vietnam, swiftlets are still considered a delicious and nutritious food. Nevertheless, in Indonesia, swiftlets are more well-known as producers of edible bird&#8217;s nest rather than as a food ingredient.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Edible Bird&#8217;s Nest: Halal and Needs to be Purified<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>According to the fatwa of the Majelis Ulama Indoensia (MUI), bird&#8217;s nest is considered halal for consumption. However, if the bird&#8217;s nest is mixed with or contaminated by impurities such as excrement, then it must be purified according to shariah (tathhir syari&#8217;i) before consumption. The procedure for tathhir syari&#8217;i for bird&#8217;s nest can refer to MUI&#8217;s fatwa No. 2 of 2010.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is important to note that although bird&#8217;s nest is considered halal, if it is obtained by damaging the habitat of swiftlets, then such a method is clearly unethical and environmentally harmful. Therefore, as consumers, we also need to choose bird&#8217;s nest products from trusted and environmentally friendly sources, and pay attention to the halal label on the products.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Overall, bird&#8217;s nest can be consumed and has benefits for the body&#8217;s health, but it must be obtained in an environmentally friendly and halal manner. Meanwhile, swiftlets as livestock are prohibited in Islam and the sustainability of swiftlets&#8217; population in the wild must be preserved. Therefore, as consumers, we also need to choose bird&#8217;s nest products from trusted and environmentally friendly sources, and pay attention to the halal label on the products.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edible Bird&#8217;s Nest: Source of Amino Acids and Heart Health Edible bird&#8217;s nest, which is produced from the saliva of swiftlets, is one of the most expensive food ingredients in the world.
