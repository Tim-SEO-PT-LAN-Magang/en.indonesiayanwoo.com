The edible bird&#8217;s nest is the most expensive food in the world and is commonly used in traditional Chinese cuisine. When it comes to the cultivation of edible bird&#8217;s nest, there are several things that need to be known, one of which is how the nest is formed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The edible bird&#8217;s nest is formed from the saliva that is excreted by the swiftlet when it creates its nest in hard-to-reach caves. The swiftlet will fly around the cave and excrete saliva that will form the nest when the saliva comes into contact with the air and dries up. The process of nest formation takes a considerable amount of time and can last for weeks to months.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Why is the Swiftlet Chosen for Cultivation?<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>The swiftlet bird is the most widely cultivated bird by farmers worldwide. There are several reasons why swiftlets are chosen for cultivation, one of which is the potential for high profits. Edible bird&#8217;s nest is a very expensive food ingredient and can reach millions of rupiahs per kilogram.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In addition, swiftlet farming is also considered an environmentally friendly business. In the process of cultivating swiftlets, no chemicals or fertilizers are required, so it does not have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, swiftlets can also help reduce the population of insects and pests around the breeding area, making the surrounding environment healthier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>How to Breed Swiftlets in a Swiftlet House<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>One way to cultivate swiftlets is by building a swiftlet house. A swiftlet house is a specialized building designed for breeding swiftlets and producing edible bird&#8217;s nests. The swiftlet house is usually built in a remote location away from crowds because swiftlets can be easily disturbed by too much activity around them.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Typically, a swiftlet house is built with a special design that resembles natural caves. The swiftlet house must have the right temperature and humidity to make the swiftlets comfortable and productive in making their nests. In addition, the swiftlet house must be equipped with special equipment such as sound systems and adjustable lighting that can be customized to the conditions of the swiftlets.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In cultivating swiftlets, farmers must pay attention to several things, such as the health of the swiftlets, the cleanliness of the swiftlet house, as well as good nutrition and care for the swiftlets.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getting to Know Swiftlets and Their Farming Techniques Swiftlet is a bird known for its unique ability to create its nest.
