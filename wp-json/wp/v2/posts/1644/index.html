The lifespan of swiftlets can vary depending on several factors. Some factors that can affect the lifespan of swiftlets are their living environment, gender, health condition, and the care given to them.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Typically, swiftlets can survive up to the age of around 15 to 18 years. However, some swiftlets are known to live longer than that. Nonetheless, the long lifespan of swiftlets cannot be determined for certain, as like any other bird, their lifespan is also influenced by many factors such as their living conditions and their own health.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Factors that Affect the Age of Edible Bird&#8217;s Nest<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>There are several factors that can affect the age of a swiftlet. Firstly, the environmental factor of their habitat. Swiftlets usually live in hard-to-reach areas, such as caves, tall trees, and high-rise buildings. If the environment where the swiftlets live is well-preserved, they can live longer and healthier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, gender can also affect the age of swiftlets. Female swiftlets usually have a longer lifespan compared to male swiftlets. This is because female swiftlets are more active in finding food and collecting materials to make nests.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, the health condition of the swiftlets also affects their lifespan. Swiftlets that are healthy and well-cared for tend to live longer. Therefore, special care is needed to maintain the health of swiftlets, such as providing healthy food, keeping the environment clean, and giving vaccinations if needed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, the age of a swiftlet can vary depending on several factors such as the environmental condition of their habitat, gender, health condition, and care provided. Swiftlets that live in a good environment and receive special care tend to live longer. As swiftlet owners, it is important to give proper attention and care to ensure that they can live longer and healthier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The swiftlet, also known as the edible-nest swiftlet, is a type of bird that has high economic value due to its ability to make expensive edible bird&#8217;s nest.
