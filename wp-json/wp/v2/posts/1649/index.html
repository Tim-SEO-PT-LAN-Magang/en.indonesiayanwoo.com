Edible bird&#8217;s nest is made from the basic material of bird saliva that contains a special substance that can harden when exposed to air. In addition to saliva, edible bird&#8217;s nest can also be mixed with other materials such as plant fibers and bird feathers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The process of forming edible bird&#8217;s nest takes a quite long time and goes through several stages. The initial stage starts with birds searching for a suitable place to build their nest. Birds usually look for places with high humidity, such as caves or under bridges.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After finding a suitable place, the bird will start producing saliva that will be used to form the nest. The saliva produced contains high levels of sugar and protein, which will then oxidize with air to harden into a nest-shaped structure.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Is edible bird&#8217;s nest harmful?<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Bird&#8217;s nest guano, also known as bird droppings, has been widely used in various applications, including as a natural fertilizer and raw material for chemical production. However, despite its significant benefits, bird&#8217;s nest guano also has some potential dangers to human health.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>One potential danger of bird&#8217;s nest guano is the presence of harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Some of these microorganisms can cause respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, when inhaled in large quantities. Therefore, it is important to avoid direct exposure to bird droppings dust and wear a mask when cleaning or processing it.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In addition, bird&#8217;s nest guano can also contain heavy metals such as lead and mercury, especially if the birds that produce the droppings consume contaminated food. Long-term exposure to heavy metals can cause damage to internal organs such as the kidneys and liver. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the source of bird&#8217;s nest guano used is free from heavy metals or has been processed and tested before use.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, despite its potential hazards to human health, bird&#8217;s nest guano is still widely used in various applications, especially in the agricultural industry as a natural fertilizer. As an alternative, bird&#8217;s nest guano can be processed into organic fertilizer that is safer and free from harmful microorganisms and heavy metals. In addition, wearing a mask when processing bird droppings can also help reduce the risk of exposure to harmful dust and microorganisms.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In the cosmetics industry, bird&#8217;s nest guano has also been used in some products such as face creams and masks. However, consumers need to be careful when using cosmetic products containing bird&#8217;s nest guano and choose products that have undergone adequate sterilization and testing to ensure product safety.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><!-- \/wp:heading --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Edible bird&#8217;s nest is made from the saliva of swiftlets.
